    "- Unified Arize & NVIDIA NeMo Customizer Fine-Tuning\n",
    "- Combines power of Arize platform and NVIDIA + Nemo microservices\n",
    "- Arize curates golden datasets from production/red teaming traces + online evaluations + human labels\n",
    "- NVIDIA nemo customizer fine-tune model based on Arize curated golden datasets\n",
    "- Run Baseline vs Fine-tuned model experiments, run evaluations and view summary metrics in Arize\n",
    "- Compare and deep dive into experiment results in Arize experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case:\n",
    "- Improve refusal quality and compliance posture of LLM:\n",
    "- LLM should respond in consistent manner, politely declining service: \"I'm sorry but I can't assist with that.\"\n",
    "- LLM should provide a reason for refusal in response: \"It is against my safety policies. Reason (Violence, self harm, illegal activity, etc.)\n",

    "3. Fine-tuning a model with datasets using NVIDIA NeMo Customizer\n",
    "4. Run experiments, upload to Arize and view/compare in Arize"
