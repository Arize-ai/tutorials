        "This guide demonstrates how to use Arize for monitoring and debugging your LLM using Traces and Spans. We're going to build a simple query engine using LlamaIndex and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to answer questions about the [Arize documentation](https://docs.arize.com/arize/). You can read more about LLM tracing [here](https://docs.arize.com/arize/llm-large-language-models/llm-traces). Arize makes your LLM applications observable by visualizing the underlying structure of each call to your query engine and surfacing problematic `spans` of execution based on latency, token count, or other evaluation metrics.\n",

It provides tools to monitor real-time model performance, even when there is a delay in receiving ground truth or feedback. Arize helps identify the root causes of model failures or performance degradation through tracing and explainability features. It also allows for multi-model performance comparisons and offers insights into drift, data quality, and model fairness or bias metrics. The platform is open and can integrate with existing machine learning infrastructure, available as both a SaaS and on-premise solution.\n"

It focuses on the challenges, use cases, and evaluation metrics for ranking models. For guidance on using an SDK to upload a ranking model, you would need to refer to the documentation or support resources specific to the SDK you are using.\n",

            ">> QUESTION: How do I configure a threshold if my data has seasonality trends?\n",
            ">> ANSWER: To configure a threshold for data with seasonality trends, you can use automatic thresholds that adjust dynamically based on your data. These thresholds are calculated using a statistical analysis of data over a 14-day period. You can modify the sensitivity of these thresholds by adjusting the standard deviation in the 'Monitor Settings' card. This allows the threshold to account for variations in your data, including seasonal trends.\n",

            ">> QUESTION: How are clusters in the UMAP calculated? When are the clusters refreshed?\n",
            ">> ANSWER: Clusters in UMAP are calculated based on the similarity of data points, where points that are closer together in the visualization are more similar to each other. This allows for the identification of groups of related points, known as clusters, within the data. Clusters are refreshed when you select a point on the drift visualization and generate a new UMAP, which updates the visualization to reflect the selected point in time.\n",
