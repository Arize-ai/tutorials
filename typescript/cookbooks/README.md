# Asset Library

This directory contains a collection of **valuable, purpose-built assets** created across various projects and initiatives. These files are **not continuously maintained**; instead, they serve as reference materials, historical artifacts, or reusable components.

Each asset includes a **Last Updated** date so readers can understand its freshness and relevance.

## Contents

You may find assets such as:

- Data samples, experiment outputs, or exploratory analyses
- Documentation or one-off write-ups from past initiatives
- Prototype code, notebooks, or supporting materials

These assets were created for specific purposes and points in time; they may not reflect the latest state of projects but remain useful for learning, context, and reuse.
